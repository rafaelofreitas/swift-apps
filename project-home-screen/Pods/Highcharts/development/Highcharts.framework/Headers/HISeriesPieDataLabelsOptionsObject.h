Specifies the method that is used to generate the connector path. Highcharts provides 3 built-in connector shapes: `'fixedOffset'` (default), `'straight'` and `'crookedLine'`. Using `'crookedLine'` has the most sense (in most of the cases) when `'alignTo'` is set. Users can provide their own method by passing a function instead of a String. 3 arguments are passed to the callback: - Object that holds the information about the coordinates of the label (`x` & `y` properties) and how the label is located in relation to the pie (`alignment` property). `alignment` can by one of the following: `'left'` (pie on the left side of the data label), `'right'` (pie on the right side of the data label) or `'center'` (data label overlaps the pie). - Object that holds the information about the position of the connector. Its `touchingSliceAt` porperty tells the position of the place where the connector touches the slice. - Data label options The function has to return an SVG path definition in array form (see the example).
